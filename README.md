# OCR-Model-Selection-App
A Flask-based OCR (Optical Character Recognition) application that allows users to upload images and extract text using various OCR models. The application supports both traditional OCR models (EasyOCR, Tesseract) and deep learning-based models (CRNN, TrOCR). Future models like YOLO and BART are listed for potential integration.
